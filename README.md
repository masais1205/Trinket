Currently implementing the following tasks:

1. Language Model
2. Image Captioning
3. Pixel RNN/Pixel CNN
4. Conditional Image Generation (GANs)
5. Text Summarization

Since many of the listed tasks can be accomplished by different models, we attempt to build an interface for each task, and users can pass in building blocks (such as a certain variants of CNN or RNN). The evaluation and experiments will be done automatically.
